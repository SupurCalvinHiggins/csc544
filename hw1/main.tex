\section*{Problem 1}

Let $Z = \{ 0 1^k 0 \mid k \geq 0 \}$.

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Give a GNFA that recognizes $Z$. \\

\noindent
The GNFA has two states: one is the start state, the other is the accept state. There is a single arrow from the start state to the accept state labeled with 
the regular expression $01^*0$. 

\subsection*{Part (b)}

Give a regular expression that generates $Z$. \\

\noindent
The expression $01^*0$ generates $Z$.

\section*{Problem 2}

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Let $L = \{ \text{abra}(\text{cad})^k\text{abra} \mid k \geq 1 \}$. Prove or disprove: $L$ is regular.

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is regular by construction. Let $A = \{ \text{abra} \}$ and $C = \{ \text{cad} \}$. Since $A$ and $C$ have finite cardinality, they 
    are regular. Define $L' = A \circ C \circ C^* \circ A$. Since $A$ and $C$ are regular, and the class of regular languages is closed under $\circ$ and $*$, 
    $L'$ is regular. \\
    
    \noindent
    We will argue that $L' = L$. Note that
    \begin{align*}
        L' &= A \circ C \circ C^* \circ A \\
        &= \{ \text{abra} \} \circ \{ \text{cad} \} \circ \{ (\text{cad})^k \mid k \geq 0 \} \circ \{ \text{abra} \} \\
        &= \{ \text{abra} \} \circ \{ (\text{cad})^k \mid k \geq 1 \} \circ \{ \text{abra} \} \\
        &=  \{ \text{abra} (\text{cad})^k \text{abra} \mid k \geq 1 \} \\
        &= L
    \end{align*} 
    so $L$ is regular as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part (b)}

Let $L = \{ (\text{abra})^r (\text{cad})^k (\text{abra})^r \mid k \geq 1, r \geq 0 \}$. Prove or disprove: $L$ is regular.

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is not regular via the pumping lemma. Assume that $L$ is regular, and let $p$ be the pumping length. Take 
    \begin{align*}
        s = (\text{abra})^p (\text{cad}) (\text{abra})^p 
    \end{align*}
    so $s \in L$. \\

    \noindent
    We will show that $s$ cannot be pumped. For any choice of $u, v, w$ such that $uvw = s$ and $1 \leq |uv| \leq p$, $v$ contains some fragment of some 
    abra to the left of cad. Pumping down, we have that $s' = uv^0w = uw \in L$. However, $s'$ contains too few symbols to form enough abra's on the left
    to match the $p$ abras on the right (\textit{the casework is too painful for anything but hand waving}), so $s' \not \in L$, which is impossible. Hence $L$
    is not regular.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 3}

Let $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$.

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Let $L = \{ xyx \mid x, y \in \Sigma^* \}$. Prove that $L$ is regular.

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is regular by construction. The main idea is that $L$ contains all strings (e.g. take $x = \epsilon$). Since $\Sigma$ has finite 
    cardinality, $\Sigma$ is regular. Define $L' = \Sigma^*$. Since $\Sigma$ is regular, and the class of regular languages is closed under $*$, $L'$ is 
    regular. \\
    
    \noindent
    We will argue that $L' = L$. Clearly $L \subseteq L' = \Sigma^*$. Fix some $s \in L'$. Let $x = \epsilon$ and $y = s$. Then $x \in \Sigma^*$ and 
    $y \in L' = \Sigma^*$. By definition, $xyx \in L$, so $xyx = \epsilon s \epsilon = s \in L$. Therefore, $L' \subseteq L$. Hence, $L' = L$, so $L$ is regular 
    as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part (b)}

Let $L = \{ xyxy \mid x, y \in \Sigma^* \}$. Prove that $L$ is not regular. 

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is not regular via the pumping lemma. Assume that $L$ is regular, and let $p$ be the pumping length. Take $x = 0^p 1^p$ and 
    $y = 0^p 1^p$. Then $x, y \in \Sigma^*$, so $s = xyxy \in L$. \\

    \noindent
    We will show that $s$ cannot be pumped. For any choice of $u, v, w$ such that $uvw = s$ and $1 \leq |uv| \leq p$, $v = 0^k$ for some $1 \leq k \leq p$ since
    the first $p$ symbols in $s$ are all zero. By the pumping lemma, $s' = uv^0w = 0^{p - k} 1^p 0^p 1^p \in L$. Suppose there exists some choice of $x', y'$ 
    such that $s' = x' y' x' y'$. Then, the first half of $s'$ is $x' y' = 0^{p - k}1^{p} 1^{k/2}$ and the second half of $s'$ is $x'y' = 1^{p-k/2}0^p$. 
    However, the first half is not the same as the second half, so $x' y' \neq x' y'$ which is impossible. Thus, there is no choice of $x' y'$ such that  
    $s' = x' y' x' y'$, so $s' \not \in L$, which is impossible. Hence $L$ is not regular as desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 4}

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Prove or disprove: the class of regular languages is closed under union.

\begin{proof}
    Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be regular languages. We will show that $L = L_1 \cup L_2$ is regular by construction. The main idea is to simulate $M_1$ and $M_2$ 
    simultaneously, and accept if either accepts. \\
    
    \noindent
    Since $L_1$ is regular, there exists some DFA $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma_1, \delta_1, q_{0}^1, F_1)$ that recognizes $L_1$, and since $L_2$ is regular, there 
    exists some DFA $M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma_2, \delta_2, q_{0}^2, F_2)$ that recognizes $L_2$. Define DFA 
    \begin{align*}
        M = ((Q_1 \cup q_{\text{reject}}) \times (Q_2 \cup q_{\text{reject}}), \Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2, \delta, (q_{0}^1, q_{0}^2), (F_1 \times Q_2) \cup (Q_1 \times F_2))
    \end{align*}
    where
    \begin{align*}
        \delta(s_k, (q_i^1, q_j^2)) = \begin{cases}
            (\delta_1(q_i^1), \delta_2(q_j^2)) & \text{ if } s_k \in \Sigma_1 \land s_k \in \Sigma_2 \land q_i^1 \in Q_1 \land q_j^2 \in Q_2 \\
            (\delta_1(q_i^1), q_{\text{reject}}) & \text{ if } s_k \in \Sigma_1 \land s_k \not \in \Sigma_2 \land q_i^1 \in Q_1 \\
            (q_{\text{reject}}, \delta_2(q_j^2)) & \text{ if } s_k \not \in \Sigma_1 \land s_k \in \Sigma_2 \land q_j^2 \in Q_2 \\
            (q_{\text{reject}}, q_{\text{reject}}) & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}

    \noindent
    We will show that $M$ recognizes $L$. First, we show that if $s \in L$, then $M$ accepts $s$. Then, we show that if $M$ accepts $s$, then $s \in L$. \\ 
    
    \noindent
    Fix some $s \in L$ such that $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_m$. Define $r_0 = (q_0^1, q_0^2)$, and $r_{i+1} = \delta(s_i, r_i)$ for $0 \leq i \leq m - 1$. Since 
    $s \in L$, either $s \in L_1$ or $s \in L_2$. Assume $s \in L_1$. Then $M_1$ accepts $s$, so there exists some $r_0^1 = q_0^1$, 
    $r_{i+1}^1 = \delta_1(s_i, r_i^1)$ for $0 \leq i \leq m - 1$, where $r_m^1 \in F_1$. Consider the sequence of states $r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_m$ taken by $M$ on 
    $s$. Since the first component of $r_0$ is $q_0^1$, by definition of $M$, the first component of each $r_i$ is $r_i^1$. Thus, the first component of $r_m$ 
    is $r_m^1$, so $r_m \in F_1 \times Q_2$. By definition, $r_m$ is an accept state, so $M$ accepts $s$. The case where $s \in L_2$ is similar. \\

    \noindent
    Fix some $s$ accepted by $M$ such that $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_m$. Then, there exists some $r_0 = (q_0^1, q_0^2)$ and $r_{i+1} = \delta(s_i, r_i)$ for 
    $0 \leq i \leq m - 1$ such that $r_m = (q_j^1, q_k^2)$ where $q_j^1 \in Q_1$ or $q_k^2 \in Q_2$. Assume $q_j^1 \in Q_1$. By definition of $M$, there exists 
    $r_0^1 = q_0^1$, $r_{i+1}^1 = \delta_1(s_i, r_i^1)$ for $0 \leq i \leq m - 1$, such that $r_{m}^1 = q_j^1 \in Q_1$, namely $r_i^1$ is the first component of
    each $r_i$. Thus, $M_1$ accepts $s$, so $s \in L_1 \subseteq L$. The case where $q_k^2 \in Q_2$ is similar. \\

    \noindent
    Thus $M$ accepts $s$ if and only if $s \in L$. Hence $L$ is regular as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part (b)}

Prove or disprove: the class of regular languages is closed under concatenation.

% idea: nfa, guess the split point starting from accept states in M_1
% eps arrow from M_1 accept to M_2 start
\begin{proof}
    Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be regular languages. We will show that $L = L_1 \circ L_2$ is regular by construction. The main idea is to non-deterministically guess 
    a split $s = a b$ such that $a \in L_1$ and $b \in L_2$. \\

    \noindent
    Since $L_1$ is regular, there exists some NFA $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma_1, \delta_1, q_0^1, F_1)$ that recognizes $L_1$, and since $L_2$ is regular, there exists
    some NFA $M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma_2, \delta_2, q_0^2, F_2)$ that recognizes $L_2$. Define NFA
    \begin{align*}
        M = (Q_1 \cup Q_2, \Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2, \delta, q_0^1, F_2)
    \end{align*}
    where
    \begin{align*}
        \delta'_1(s_k, q_i) &= \begin{cases}
            \delta_1(s_k, q_i) & \text{ if } q_i \in Q_1 \land s_k \in \Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \} \\
            \emptyset & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases} \\
        \delta'_2(s_k, q_i) &= \begin{cases}
            \delta_2(s_k, q_i) & \text{ if } q_i \in Q_2 \land s_k \in \Sigma_2 \cup \{ \epsilon \} \\
            \emptyset & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases} \\
        \delta(s_k, q_i) &= \begin{cases}
            \delta'_1(s_k, q_i) \cup \{ q_0^2 \} & \text{ if } q_i \in F_1 \land s_k = \epsilon \\
            \delta'_1(s_k, q_i) \cup \delta'_2(s_k, q_i) & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    We will show that $M$ recognizes $L$. First, we show that if $s \in L$, then $M$ accepts $s$. Then, we show that if $M$ accepts $s$, then $s \in L$. \\

    \noindent
    Fix some $s \in L$ where $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_m$. Then, there exists $a \in L_1$ and $b \in L_2$ such that $s = a b$. Since $a \in L_1$, $M_1$ 
    accepts $a$. Therefore, there exists some $r_0^1 = q_0^1$, $r_i^1 \in \delta_1(a_i, r_{i-1}^1)$ for $1 \leq i \leq |a|$, where $r_{|a|}^1 \in F_1$. Likewise, 
    $M_2$ accepts $b$. Therefore, there exists some $r_0^2 = q_0^2$, $r_i^2 \in \delta_2(b_i, r_{i-1}^2)$ for $1 \leq i \leq |b|$, where $r_{|b|}^2 \in F_2$. 
    Define $s' = a \epsilon b = s$, and $r = r_1 r_2 \ldots r_{|s'|}$ where
    \begin{align*}
        r_{i} = \begin{cases}
            r_0^1 & \text{ if } i = 0 \\
            r_i^1 & \text{ if } 1 \leq i \leq |a| \\
            r_0^2 & \text{ if } i = |a| + 1 \\
            r_i^2 & \text{ if } |a| + 2 \leq i \leq |s'|
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Now, we must verify that $r$ is an accepting computation of $M$ on $s'$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We have that $r_0 = r_0^1 = q_0^1$ which is the start state of $M$.
        \item We consider three subcases
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Assume $1 \leq i \leq |a|$. Then 
            \begin{align*}
                r_i = r_i^1 \in \delta_1(a_i, r_{i-1}^1) = \delta'_1(s'_i, r_{i-1}) \subseteq \delta(s'_i, r_{i-1})
            \end{align*}

            \item Assume $i = |a| + 1$. Then 
            \begin{align*}
                r_i = r_0^2 = q_0^2 \in \delta(\epsilon, r_{|a|}^1) = \delta(s'_{|a|}, r_{i-1}) 
            \end{align*}

            \item Assume $|a| + 2 \leq i \leq |s'|$. Then
            \begin{align*}
                r_i = r_i^2 \in \delta_2(b_i, r_{i-|a|-2}^2) = \delta'_1(s'_i, r_{i-1}) \subseteq \delta(s'_i, r_{i-1})
            \end{align*}
        \end{enumerate}
        so for all $1 \leq i \leq |s'|$, $r_i \in \delta(s'_i, r_{i-1})$.
        \item We have that $r_{|s'|} = r_{|b|}^2 \in F_2$, so the final state is an accept state.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, $M$ accepts $s$. \\

    \noindent
    Fix some $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_m$ where $M$ accepts $s$. Then, there exists some accepting sequence of states 
    $r = r_1 r_2 \ldots r_t \epsilon r_{t+2} \ldots r_m$, where $r$ must contain $\epsilon$ otherwise all $q \in Q_2$ are unreachable, which is impossible since
    $r_m \in F_2 \subseteq Q_2$. Define $a = s_1 \ldots s_{k}$ and $b = s_{k+2} \ldots s_m$. We must show that $a \in L_1$ and $b \in L_1$. First, we show that 
    $a \in L_1$. Since  \\
    
    \noindent
    Thus $M$ accepts $s$ if and only if $s \in L$. Hence $L$ is regular as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part (c)}

Prove or disprove: the class of regular languages is closed under star.
