\section*{Problem 2}

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Let $L = \{ \text{abra}(\text{cad})^k\text{abra} \mid k \geq 1 \}$. Prove or disprove: $L$ is regular.

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is regular by construction. Let $A = \{ \text{abra} \}$ and $C = \{ \text{cad} \}$. Since $A$ and $C$ have finite cardinality, they 
    are regular. Define $L' = A \circ C \circ C^* \circ A$. Since $A$ and $C$ are regular, and the class of regular languages is closed under $\circ$ and $*$, 
    $L'$ is regular. \\
    
    \noindent
    We will argue that $L' = L$. Note that
    \begin{align*}
        L' &= A \circ C \circ C^* \circ A \\
        &= \{ \text{abra} \} \circ \{ \text{cad} \} \circ \{ (\text{cad})^k \mid k \geq 0 \} \circ \{ \text{abra} \} \\
        &= \{ \text{abra} \} \circ \{ (\text{cad})^k \mid k \geq 1 \} \circ \{ \text{abra} \} \\
        &=  \{ \text{abra} (\text{cad})^k \text{abra} \mid k \geq 1 \} \\
        &= L
    \end{align*} 
    so $L$ is regular as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part (b)}

Let $L = \{ (\text{abra})^r (\text{cad})^k (\text{abra})^r \mid k \geq 1, r \geq 0 \}$. Prove or disprove: $L$ is regular.

    TODO
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 3}

Let $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$.

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Let $L = \{ xyx \mid x, y \in \Sigma^* \}$. Prove that $L$ is regular.

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is regular by construction. The main idea is that $L$ contains all strings (e.g. take $x = \epsilon$). Since $\Sigma$ has finite 
    cardinality, $\Sigma$ is regular. Define $L' = \Sigma^*$. Since $\Sigma$ is regular, and the class of regular languages is closed under $*$, $L'$ is 
    regular. \\
    
    \noindent
    We will argue that $L' = L$. Clearly $L \subseteq L' = \Sigma^*$. Fix some $s \in L'$. Let $x = \epsilon$ and $y = s$. Then $x \in \Sigma^*$ and 
    $y \in L' = \Sigma^*$. By definition, $xyx \in L$, so $xyx = \epsilon s \epsilon = s \in L$. Therefore, $L' \subseteq L$. Hence, $L' = L$, so $L$ is regular 
    as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part (b)}

Let $L = \{ xyxy \mid x, y \in \Sigma^* \}$. Prove that $L$ is not regular. 

\begin{proof}
    We will show that $L$ is not regular via the pumping lemma. Assume that $L$ is regular, and let $p$ be the pumping length. Take $x = 0^p 1^p$ and 
    $y = 0^p 1^p$. Then $x, y \in \Sigma^*$, so $s = xyxy \in L$. \\

    \noindent
    We will show that $s$ cannot be pumped. For any choice of $u, v, w$ such that $uvw = s$ and $1 \leq |uv| \leq p$, $v = 0^k$ for some $1 \leq k \leq p$ since
    the first $p$ symbols in $s$ are all zero. By the pumping lemma, $s' = uv^0w = 0^{p - k} 1^p 0^p 1^p \in L$. Suppose there exists some choice of $x', y'$ 
    such that $s' = x' y' x' y'$. Then, the first half of $s'$ is $x' y' = 0^{p - k}1^{p} 1^{k/2}$ and the second half of $s'$ is $x'y' = 1^{p-k/2}0^p$. 
    However, the first half is not the same as the second half, so $x' y' \neq x' y'$ which is impossible. Thus, there is no choice of $x' y'$ such that  
    $s' = x' y' x' y'$, so $s' \not \in L$, which is impossible. Hence $L$ is not regular as desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 4}

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Prove or disprove: the class of regular languages is closed under union.

\begin{proof}
    Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be regular languages. We will show that $L = L_1 \cup L_2$ is regular by construction. \\
    
    \noindent
    Since $L_1$ is regular, there exists some DFA $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma_1, \delta_1, q_{0}^1, F_1)$ that recognizes $L_1$, and since $L_2$ is regular, there 
    exists some DFA $M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma_2, \delta_2, q_{0}^2, F_2)$ that recognizes $L_2$. Define DFA 
    \begin{align*}
        M = ((Q_1 \cup q_{\text{reject}}) \times (Q_2 \cup q_{\text{reject}}), \Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2, \delta, (q_{0}^1, q_{0}^2), (F_1 \times Q_2) \cup (Q_1 \times F_2))
    \end{align*}
    where
    \begin{align*}
        \delta(s_k, (q_i^1, q_j^2)) = \begin{cases}
            (\delta_1(q_i^1), \delta_2(q_j^2)) & \text{ if } s_k \in \Sigma_1 \land s_k \in \Sigma_2 \land q_i^1 \in Q_1 \land q_j^2 \in Q_2 \\
            (\delta_1(q_i^1), q_{\text{reject}}) & \text{ if } s_k \in \Sigma_1 \land s_k \not \in \Sigma_2 \land q_i^1 \in Q_1 \\
            (q_{\text{reject}}, \delta_2(q_j^2)) & \text{ if } s_k \not \in \Sigma_1 \land s_k \in \Sigma_2 \land q_j^2 \in Q_2 \\
            (q_{\text{reject}}, q_{\text{reject}}) & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}

    \noindent
    We will show that $M$ recognizes $L$. \\ 
    
    \noindent
    Fix some $s \in L$. Then $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_m$. TODO.
